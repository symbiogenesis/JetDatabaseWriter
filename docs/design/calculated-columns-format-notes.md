# Calculated columns — format notes & implementation gameplan

This document captures everything we know about Access 2010+ calculated columns
(also called "expression columns") and the multi-phase plan for full read/write
support in `JetDatabaseWriter`. The reference implementation throughout is
[Jackcess](https://github.com/jahlborn/jackcess) (Java, Apache 2.0). Specific
files we translate from:

- [`CalculatedColumnUtil.java`](https://github.com/jahlborn/jackcess/blob/master/src/main/java/com/healthmarketscience/jackcess/impl/CalculatedColumnUtil.java) — the wrapper format and read/write helpers.
- [`ColumnImpl.java`](https://github.com/jahlborn/jackcess/blob/master/src/main/java/com/healthmarketscience/jackcess/impl/ColumnImpl.java) — descriptor parsing, column-flag plumbing, fixed-vs-variable handling for calc columns, and `getCalculationContext()` integration with the expression evaluator.
- [`JetFormat.java`](https://github.com/jahlborn/jackcess/blob/master/src/main/java/com/healthmarketscience/jackcess/impl/JetFormat.java) — `CALC_FIXED_FIELD_LEN`, `CALCULATED_EXT_FLAG_MASK`, etc.
- The whole `com.healthmarketscience.jackcess.impl.expr` package — the
  expression lexer/parser/evaluator (Phase 2/3).

## On-disk format

Calculated columns are an ACCDB-only (ACE) feature. The Jet3 MDB
descriptor has no slot for the extra-flags byte, so calc columns cannot exist in
those files. The writer rejects calculated columns for Jet3/Jet4 `.mdb` output.

### 1. Extra-flags byte (column descriptor)

Each ACE column descriptor is 25 bytes. The byte at **offset 16** is the
"extra flags" byte. A column is calculated when the **high two bits** are set:

| Constant | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CALCULATED_EXT_FLAG_MASK` | `0xC0` | `JetFormat.CALCULATED_EXT_FLAG_MASK` |

Mirrored in this codebase as `Constants.CalculatedColumn.ExtFlagMask`.
`AccessBase.LoadColumnInfos` reads it into `ColumnInfo.ExtraFlags` and exposes
`ColumnInfo.IsCalculated`.

### 2. Persisted expression & result type (LvProp)

Two `MSysObjects.LvProp` entries on the column carry the expression and the
declared result type:

| Property name | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Expression` | `Memo`/`Text` | The Access/VBA expression text (e.g. `[FirstName] & " " & [LastName]`). |
| `ResultType` | `Byte` | The JET data-type code the expression evaluates to. |

Names are pinned in `Constants.ColumnPropertyNames.Expression` /
`.ResultType`. `AccessReader.GetColumnMetadataAsync` populates
`ColumnMetadata.CalculationExpression` and `.CalculatedResultType` from them.

### 3. Stored value wrapper (data pages)

Even though the value is calculated by the engine, Access also **persists the
last evaluated result** on the row, prefixed by a 23-byte header:

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CALC_EXTRA_DATA_LEN` | `23` | Header length prepended to every stored value. |
| `CALC_DATA_LEN_OFFSET` | `16` | Offset within the header where the payload length (Int32 LE) lives. |
| `CALC_DATA_OFFSET` | `20` | Offset within the header where the payload begins. |
| `CALC_FIXED_FIELD_LEN` | `39` | The fixed-portion column length used for *all* fixed-width calc columns (largest fixed payload `16` + the `23`-byte header). |

For variable-width source types the on-disk `col_len` becomes
`originalLen + CALC_EXTRA_DATA_LEN`. For fixed-width source types it is forced
to `CALC_FIXED_FIELD_LEN` regardless of the underlying type. Long-value result
types (`MEMO` / `OLE`) keep the normal LVAL row header in the row; the bytes
inside the LVAL payload are wrapped.

The descriptor `col_type` controls how the wrapped value is placed in the row,
but the `ResultType` LvProp controls how the wrapped payload is decoded. Access
can store boolean calculated columns with an integer descriptor type while
declaring `ResultType = T_BOOL`, so readers must honour `ResultType` for the
payload.

Two result types have Access-specific payload encodings inside the wrapper:

- `T_BOOL`: one byte, `0xFF` for true and `0x00` for false. Calculated booleans
  are not stored in the row null mask.
- `T_NUMERIC`: 16 bytes: a 2-byte payload-length prefix, scale byte, sign byte
  (`0x80` for negative), then the 96-bit decimal mantissa in Access's calculated
  numeric byte order. This is not the normal 17-byte `T_NUMERIC` fixed slot.

Helpers in this codebase: `CalculatedColumnUtil.Wrap` / `.Unwrap` (round-trip
verified by `CalculatedColumnUtilTests`).

## Phased implementation plan

### Phase 1A — Read-side metadata + foundation **(DONE)**

Goal: surface calc-column metadata to clients and recognise the format on disk.

Delivered:

- `Constants.CalculatedColumn` constants (mask, header layout, fixed length).
- `Constants.ColumnPropertyNames.Expression` / `.ResultType`.
- `CalculatedColumnUtil.Wrap` / `.Unwrap` (round-trip + truncation tests).
- `ColumnInfo.ExtraFlags` + `ColumnInfo.IsCalculated`.
- `AccessBase.LoadColumnInfos` reads byte at descriptor offset 16 (ACE only;
  Jet3 hard-coded to `0`).
- `ColumnDefinition` / `ColumnMetadata` `IsCalculated`, `CalculationExpression`,
  `CalculatedResultType` properties.
- `AccessReader.GetColumnMetadataAsync` extracts `Expression` / `ResultType`
  from LvProp.
- Tests: `JetDatabaseWriter.Tests/Schema/CalculatedColumnUtilTests.cs`,
  expanded metadata fixture coverage.

### Phase 1B — Write & round-trip the persisted value **(DONE)**

Goal: be able to create a calc column, store an evaluated value, and have both
ourselves and Access read it back correctly. Still **no client-side
evaluation**: the caller supplies the literal value to persist, plus the
expression text; Access will recompute on next open.

Jackcess sources to translate:

- `CalculatedColumnUtil.create*Handler` factory methods — they wrap an existing
  `ColumnImpl` to override `read` / `write` / `getType` / `isVariableLength`.
- The `ColumnImpl` constructor branch that detects `extraFlags & 0xC0`,
  rewrites `_columnLength`, and forces the column into the variable-length
  bucket so it can store the wrapper.
- `ColumnImpl.writeRealCodecHandler` calls into the wrapper helpers.

Delivered:

- `Schema/TDefPageBuilder` emits the `0xC0` extra-flags byte, adjusts `col_len`,
  and treats every calculated column as variable-area storage.
- `Schema/JetExpressionConverter.ApplyColumn` emits `Expression` as Memo and
  `ResultType` as Byte in `MSysObjects.LvProp`.
- `AccessWriter.CreateTableAsync` accepts calculated columns for ACCDB, validates
  expression/result-type constraints, and rejects unsupported Jet3/Jet4 MDB
  targets.
- `ValueEncoding/RowEncoder` wraps cached values by result type, including
  calculated booleans, calculated numeric payloads, and calculated MEMO values
  whose wrapped payload spills to LVAL pages.
- `AccessReader` unwraps calculated cached values on the string, typed
  `DataTable`, and POCO paths; the compiled direct POCO decoder falls back to
  the unwrap-aware path for any bound calculated column.
- Tests: `JetDatabaseWriter.Tests/Writer/CalculatedColumnWriteTests.cs`,
  updated Access-authored fixture coverage in
  `JetDatabaseWriter.Tests/Schema/CalculatedColumnFixtureTests.cs`, and
  byte-level cached-payload assertions in
  `JetDatabaseWriter.Tests/Schema/CalculatedColumnPayloadTests.cs` (including
  DAO-authored `IIf` / `Switch` calculated fields on Access-equipped hosts).

### Phase 2 — Subset expression evaluator **(DONE)**

Goal: on `INSERT` / `UPDATE`, recompute the value ourselves so callers do not
have to supply it, and so updates to dependent columns refresh the persisted
value the same way Access does.

Delivered:

- Added [ClosedXML.Parser](https://github.com/ClosedXML/ClosedXML.Parser) for
  formula parsing and an internal AST factory that maps parser nodes into the
  row-local calculated-column evaluator. ClosedXML.Parser handles expression
  parsing only; all Access/ACE storage and type coercion remains in this
  library.
- `ConstraintRegistry` evaluates calculated columns during inserts when the row
  omits the cached value or supplies `NULL`/`DBNull`, and recomputes calculated
  columns during updates after source values are applied.
- Caller-supplied cached values still work on insert. This preserves Phase 1B
  behavior and lets unsupported expressions be persisted when the caller has
  already computed the value.
- Expressions are normalized for common Access syntax: leading `=` is ignored,
  bracketed column references such as `[Column Name]` resolve against the
  in-flight row, `#date literal#` becomes `DATEVALUE("date literal")`, and
  Access word operators are lowered into evaluator functions before the
  ClosedXML.Parser pass.
- Calculated columns may reference earlier or later calculated columns in the
  same row; dependency evaluation is lazy and circular references are rejected.

Supported subset:

- Operators: arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `\`, `^`, `Mod`), string
  concatenation (`&`), comparisons (`=`, `<>`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`), logical
  word operators (`Not`, `And`, `Or`, `Xor`, `Eqv`, `Imp`), and Access special
  comparisons (`Is [Not] Null`, `[Not] Like`, `[Not] Between`, `[Not] In`).
- Constants and nulls: `True`/`False`, `Yes`/`No`, `On`/`Off`, common `vb*`
  constants, blank/null nodes, and `DBNull` values from the in-flight row.
- Built-ins: `IIf`/`IF`, `Nz`, `IsNull`/`IsBlank`, `IsNumeric`/`IsNumber`,
  `IsDate`, `Len`, `Left`, `Right`, `Mid`, `UCase`/`Upper`, `LCase`/`Lower`,
  `Trim`, `LTrim`, `RTrim`, `Replace`, `InStr`, `InStrRev`, `Space`,
  `StrComp`, `StrConv`, `String`, `StrReverse`, `Asc`/`AscW`, `Chr`/`ChrW`,
  `Str`, string-returning `$` aliases such as `Left$`/`UCase$`, `Format*`
  helpers, `Abs`, `Round`, `Int`, `Fix`, `Sgn`, `Sqr`, `Sin`, `Cos`, `Tan`,
  `Atn`/`Atan`, `Exp`, `Log`, `Date`/`Today`, `Now`, `Time`, `DateValue`,
  `DateSerial`, `DateAdd`, `DateDiff`, `DatePart`, `Year`, `Month`, `Day`,
  `Hour`, `Minute`, `Second`, `TimeValue`, `TimeSerial`, `Timer`, `MonthName`,
  `Weekday`, `WeekdayName`, `CInt`, `CLng`, `CDbl`, `CSng`, `CCur`/`CDec`,
  `CStr`, `CDate`/`CVDate`, `CBool`, `CByte`, `CVar`, `VarType`, `TypeName`,
  `Hex`, `Oct`, `Val`, common financial helpers (`FV`, `PV`, `Pmt`, `NPer`,
  `IPmt`, `PPmt`, `DDB`, `SLN`, `SYD`, `Rate`), `Choose`, and `Switch`.

Still intentionally out of scope: domain aggregate functions (`DLookup`,
`DCount`, `DSum`, `DAvg`, `DMin`, `DMax`), SQL/query evaluation, cross-record
or cross-table lookups, and spreadsheet-only parser constructs such as cell,
sheet, external workbook, array, range, and structured references.

Tests: focused insert/update/POCO coverage in
`JetDatabaseWriter.Tests/Writer/CalculatedColumnWriteTests.cs`, plus the Phase
1B Access-authored fixture coverage.

### Phase 3 — Non-row-local expression contexts

- Domain aggregate functions (`DLookup`, `DCount`, `DSum`, `DAvg`, `DMin`,
  `DMax`), SQL/query evaluation, and cross-record / cross-table lookup context
  remain outside calculated-column support because Access calculated columns are
  row-local.
- `Partition` and the long tail of highly specialized VBA functions can be
  added if real Access-authored calculated-column fixtures show they are valid
  in this context.

## Why phased

Each phase is independently shippable and independently testable against a
real Microsoft Access oracle:

1. **1A** lets clients *detect* calc columns and decide whether to error.
2. **1B** unblocks anyone who computes the value themselves (e.g. ETL tools).
3. **2** covers the >95% of real-world Access expressions.
4. **3** is for parity with the long tail.

This avoids a multi-week mega-PR and keeps the scope of each Jackcess
translation bounded.
